#🐾 PawConnect - The Universal Pet Adoption & Care Ecosystem
🚀 About the Project

PawConnect is an all-in-one pet adoption and care platform that connects shelters, NGOs, veterinarians, and pet lovers in one place. Unlike existing apps that focus only on cats and dogs, PawConnect supports all animals, including birds, rabbits, reptiles, and farm animals.
